Run MalwareBlocker.exe 
Malware samples that are detected are in the folder labelled malware. All malware is pointed towards an invalid address or your local address (127.0.0.1) however still take caution and run in a virtual machine if possible.
Code can be viewed from the visual studio solution file in the malwareblocker folder.

The code is a little messy but its highly commented. Some parts are yet to be implemented.
